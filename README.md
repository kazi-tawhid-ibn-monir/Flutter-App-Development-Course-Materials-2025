# Flutter App Development Course Materials – 2025

This repository contains all the learning materials, resources, and practice projects from my **Flutter App Development Course**.

## 📅 Course Goal
To track, commit, and organize everything I learn in Flutter — from beginner to advanced — following the order of classes.

## 📁 Structure
Each class will have its own folder or commit, containing:
- 📝 Notes and explanations
- 💻 Practice code and mini projects
- 📂 Resources (PDFs, images, references)
- ✅ Assignments and challenges

## 🔄 Commit Strategy
I will commit:
- After each class session (as `class-1`, `class-2`, etc.)
- Any updates or additional practice
- As clearly as possible (e.g., `add: ListView example`, `fix: image loading issue`)

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Flutter SDK (stable channel)
- Dart
- Android Studio / VS Code
- Git & GitHub for version control

## 🧠 Why This Repo?
- Keep all my learning in one place
- Easily track progress over time
- Help others who want to learn Flutter
- Build a professional habit of committing code

## 📌 Status
✅ Course Started: `May 2025`  
🚀 Ongoing: New commits every day as I learn  
🎯 Goal: Complete a strong Flutter portfolio by the end of the course
